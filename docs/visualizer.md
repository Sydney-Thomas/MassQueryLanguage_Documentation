MassQL has a visualizer to help you figure out what your query is looking for. It is available at our [sandbox](https://msql.ucsd.edu/). 

The following will describe but the shapes and symbols mean

## MS Peak Mass

This can be either MS2PROD or MS1MZ, green boxes around where the allowble m/z tolerance determined by qualifiers is set. 

## MS2 Neutral Loss

Lorem Ipsum

## Peak Intensity Minimum

This is a red dashed line

## Peak Intensity Match

The ranges are purple dashed lines

## Variables

You can set the variables you want with Value X and Value Y

## Overlaying Real Data

If you enter the USI for the MS1 or MS2 spectra, you can overlay your query with an actual spectrum to workshop what you're trying to find.
